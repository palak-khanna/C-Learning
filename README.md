Introduction
This repository contains materials to help you learn C programming language and data structures from scratch. The aim is to build a strong foundation in programming by starting with basic syntax and progressing to complex data structures like linked lists, stacks, and trees.

Who is this for?
Beginners with little or no programming experience
Programmers who want to refresh their knowledge of C and data structures
Developers transitioning to low-level programming and system design

Course Structure
1. Basics of C Programming
Introduction to C: History and usage of C language
Hello World Program: Your first C program
Data Types: Integers, floating points, characters, etc.
Variables and Constants: Declaration and usage
